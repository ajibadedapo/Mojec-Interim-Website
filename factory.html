    <h1>Our Manufacturing Facility is second to none in Nigeria</h1>
    <p>
      Our state of the art working environment, automatic test benches, dedicated staff and with a huge working experience to draw from. We have align ourselves over the years with international experts in the birth of this vision in giving it a standard that can compete on the world stage. Quality of service has been the bedrock of MOJEC INTERNATIONAL and that is why a lot has been put into the setup of the multibillionaire project, i.e. making meters available to every consumer of electricity in Nigeria and beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      The installed capacity is enough to roll out over a million meters yearly, with fully automatic test benches, and the highest number of such in Nigeria. Most of our Manufacturing processes are computerized which has helped us in delivering our goods on time every time.
    </p>
    Our Quality Management System as over the years make sure that the roll out of large amount of meters is not the primary aim, but making sure that every meter coming out of the factory is verified ok. Quality is part of our production process to ensure that all product are fit for purpose.
